## Overview

This repository defines **Learning Flow**, a learning design methodology focused on:

- Low-friction knowledge intake  
- Long-duration learning environments  
- Structured interruption points that enforce real capability formation  

This is **not a product**, **not a platform**, and **not a course**.  
It is a conceptual framework intended to explore how learning systems can align with modern attention behaviors without sacrificing depth.

## Problem Context

Most formal education systems rely on long, synchronous, high-friction instructional formats.

For many learners, the primary issue is not content difficulty, but:

- Rapid cognitive fatigue  
- Loss of attention autonomy  
- High psychological resistance to sustained participation  

Meanwhile, short-form content platforms demonstrate that humans can remain engaged for long periods in environments that are:

- Interruptible  
- Self-paced  
- Low-pressure  

Learning Flow explores whether these behavioral patterns can be structurally adapted **without reducing learning to entertainment**.

---

## Core Hypothesis

Learning resistance is primarily caused by **format**, not **content**.

However, purely passive consumption leads to *illusion of understanding*.

Therefore:

> Learning can be designed as a **feed-like flow**,  
> but must include **enforced dive points** that require non-passive engagement.

## Methodology Structure (Abstract)

Learning Flow consists of three conceptual layers:

1. **Surface Layer**  
   Short, single-concept, low-friction content units  
   Cross-topic continuity is allowed and intentional  

2. **Flow Control Layer**  
   Progression based on completed units, not time spent  
   Learners retain full interruption and pacing autonomy  

3. **Dive Point Layer**  
   Mandatory checkpoints where understanding alone is insufficient  
   Designed to break fluency illusion and surface actual capability  

Specific implementation parameters are intentionally omitted.

## What This Is Not

- A traditional online course  
- A short-video learning platform  
- A productivity tool  
- A time-based learning system  

This repository defines a **learning design methodology**, not an executable product.

## Purpose of Publication

This repository serves as:

- Prior public disclosure  
- Conceptual definition and authorship record  
- Foundation for future research, experimentation, or collaboration  

Commercialization paths, if any, are intentionally not specified at this stage.
